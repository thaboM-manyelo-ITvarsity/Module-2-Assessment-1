                    <h3>MONKEYS</h3>
                    <p> Monkey is a common name that may refer to most mammals of the infraorder Simiiformes, also known as the simians. 
                        Traditionally, all animals in the group now known as simians are counted as monkeys except the apes, which constitutes an incomplete paraphyletic grouping; however, 
                        in the broader sense based on cladistics, apes (Hominoidea) are also included, making the terms monkeys and simians synonyms in regards to their scope.</p>
                    <p> Many monkey species are tree-dwelling (arboreal), although there are species that live primarily on the ground, such as baboons. 
                        Most species are mainly active during the day (diurnal). Monkeys are generally considered to be intelligent, especially the Old World monkeys.</p> 
                    <p><strong>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</strong></p>
                    <p>You will find the monkeys at pen E19, at the monkey trail. </p>
