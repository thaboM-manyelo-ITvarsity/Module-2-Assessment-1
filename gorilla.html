                    <h3>GORILLAS</h3>
                    <p>Gorillas are herbivorous, predominantly ground-dwelling great apes that inhabit the tropical forests of equatorial Africa. 
                        The genus Gorilla is divided into two species: the eastern gorilla and the western gorilla, and either four or five subspecies. 
                        The DNA of gorillas is highly similar to that of humans, from 95 to 99% depending on what is included, and they are the next closest living relatives to humans after chimpanzees and bonobos.</p>
                    <p> Gorillas are the largest living primates, reaching heights between 1.25 and 1.8 metres, weights between 100 and 270 kg, and arm spans up to 2.6 metres, depending on species and sex. 
                        They tend to live in troops, with the leader being called a silverback. The Eastern gorilla is distinguished from the Western by darker fur colour and some other minor morphological differences. 
                        Gorillas tend to live 35–40 years in the wild. The oldest gorilla ever is Fatou (b. 1957), who is still alive at the advanced age of 65 years.</p> 
                    <p><strong>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</strong></p>
                    <p>You will find the gorillas at pen E25, right next to the tigers. </p>
